# Governed Publication System

## Purpose
Demonstrate a minimal but strict domain model
focused on state transitions and responsibility.

## Domain Rules
- Publications follow explicit state transitions
- Business rules live in the domain, not in controllers
- Published content is immutable

## Architecture
- Clean Architecture
- Domain free of frameworks
- Explicit use cases

## Trade-offs
- No CRUD endpoints
- No categories or comments
- Focus on correctness over features

## What this project is NOT
- A CMS
- A blog engine
- A feature showcase
